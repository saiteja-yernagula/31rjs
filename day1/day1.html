    javascript ---- java

    mocha---live script

    microsoft - jscript


    java - sun microsystems- javascript


    javascript was introduced in 1995 by brendan eich 
    it was developed within in 10days

    standardization - ECMASCRIPT

    versions
     ES-1 -1997
     ES-2 - 1998
     ES-3 - 1999
     ES-4 -
     ES-5 - 2009
     ES-6 - 2015---changes and pre requistic

     usage of js
     1) web development
     2) mobile app development
     3) game devlopment
     4) server side development- node js
     5) desktop application
     6) iot


     what is javascript
     javascript is a high level programming languagge
     that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages

     Terms
     High level
     interpreter and compiler- converts highlevel to lowlevel
                    interpreter - it executes one line at a time and line by line
     lightweight- doesnt require large space abd resources
     crooss platform- supports every browser and device

     single threaded-  it can perform one operation at a time per thread.
     
     interpreted compiled
     scripting language - we can integrate to web page


     html css- static webpages- browser
     js - dynamic web pages- javascript engine - browser
          runtime environment - node js - we can run js without browser

    js engines
    chrome - v8 engine
    firefox - spider monkey
    edge-chakra
    safari - javascript core


    how javascript engine works

    code - 
    parsing - checks the syntax 
    abstract syntax tree- tokens genrate- categorized
    interpreter - converts - takes helps from compiler - jit(just in time)
    execution


    console.log("line 1")
    console.log("line 2")---time -60mins
    console.log("line 3")


    synchronous tasks
    line 1
    line 3

    asynchrnous tasks- whihc takes time and execute parallely
     line 2


     event loop mechanism
     1) callstack - executes the functions 
     2) webapi - provides some apis (timers,location, apicalls)
     3) callback que-
     4) event loop -


     line 1- 
     line - 2- takes time
     line - 3
     line -4 - takes time
     line - 5
     1000lines
     






write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 

Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different types of variables
 (var, let, and const) and prints their values to the console.

Create variables of different data types:
 number, string, boolean, undefined, null, object, array, and function
 
Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable to the console




Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.

Write a JavaScript script that uses the ternary operator to determine
 if a number is even or odd.

Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades:
  A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45).
   Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30),
  "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10). 
  Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child"
  (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
  and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result.
















day 
Task 1: Day of the Week Message
Scenario: Develop a webpage that displays a special message 
based on the current day of the week.

“Start your week strong!” for Monday.
“Keep going!” for Tuesday.
“Halfway there!” for Wednesday.
“Almost the weekend!” for Thursday.
“Happy Friday!” for Friday.
“Enjoy your weekend!” for Saturday and Sunday.
Task:
Get the current day of the week.
Display the corresponding message.



Task 2: Traffic Light Simulation
Scenario: Simulate a traffic light system.

“Stop” if the light is red.
“Get Ready” if the light is yellow.
“Go” if the light is green.
Task:

Prompt the user to enter the color of the traffic light.
Display the corresponding action.



Task 3: Discount Calculator
Scenario: Calculate the discount based on the
 total purchase amount.

“No discount” if the amount is less than $50.
“5% discount” if the amount is between $50 and $100.
“10% discount” if the amount is between $101 and $200.
“15% discount” if the amount is above $200.
Task:

Prompt the user to enter the total purchase amount.
Display the discount percentage.


Task 4: Restaurant Menu
Scenario: You are developing a restaurant menu 
system that provides the price of a dish based
 on the dish name.

Task:
Assume a variable dish holds the name of the dish
 as a string (e.g.,  "Biriyani", "shawarma", "Fried rice", "veg pula").
Print the price.

Task 5: Simple Calculator
Scenario: You are developing a simple calculator 
that performs basic arithmetic operations.

Task:

Assume variables num1 and num2 hold two numbers, 
and operator holds the arithmetic operator as a string (e.g., “+”).
Use a switch case statement to perform the operation and
 store the result in a variable result.
Print the result.
