    usage of js
    what  is js
    js terms
    how js engine works--code ----parsing----ast(tokens)---interpreter(jit)
    event loop mechanism---callstack     webapi    callback que    eventloop


    how to insert js to the html
    1) inline
    <button onclick="alert('inline js')">click</button>
       
    2) internal
      using script tag - included at the bottom of the body

    3) external
      using separate js file with .js extension
      link using script src="demo.js"

    variables
    variables are like containers that is used to store data
    and the data could be any data type

    variable syntax
    variables are defined with var, let and const keywords
    followed by variable name (identifier)

    identifier have some rules
    1) it can contain letters, digits, underscore and dollar sign
    2) it should start with alphabets, underscore or dollar sign
    3) are case sensitive , a and  A are not same
    4) reserved words cannot be used as variable names

    _name="john"
    $name="john"
    _name123="john"
    studentName="john"

    2name="jon"  -no
    2 name="jon"  - no
    if="jon"

    var somename="hello"


    variable terms

    1) variable declaration
       var a;

    2) undefined 
       a variable without an value

    3) not defined
       non existing variable
       error which comes when we log a variable which is not declared

     4) assignment
     var a;
     a=10;

     5)  reassignment
     var a;//declarartion

       a=10;//assignment
       a-20;//re assignment

       6) initialization
       declaring and assigning in a same line
        var a=10;  //initialization


        7) hoisting
         Hoisting is a behaviour where the declarations of variable
         and functions are moved to top even before the execution



       


    datatypes
    a) primitive data types
       1) which store the single values
       2) which are immutable- means we cannot change the value once it is assigned
       3) get by value and pass by value
       4) it was stored in stack


       1) strings- collections of characters which are enclosed in '' or "" quotes
          var str="hello"

       2) number- decimal or integer values
           var num=10.5
           var num=10

       3) boolean
          var bol=true;
          var bol=false;

       4) undefined
          variable without an value

       5) null
         intentionally empty variable



    b) non primitive data types
      1) which store the multiple values
      2) which are mutable- means we can change the values
      3) get by reference and pass by reference
      4) it was stored in heap

      1) arrays- it is used to store the collection of values

      2) objects- it is used to store the data in key value pairs

      3) functions - block of code is executed to perform a specific task when we invoke
      
      4) sets maps
      5) date
