     what is javascript
     javascript is a high level programming languagge
     that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages

     Terms
     High level
     interpreter and compiler- converts highlevel to lowlevel
                    interpreter - it executes one line at a time and line by line
     lightweight- doesnt require large space abd resources
     crooss platform- supports every browser and device

     single threaded-  it can perform one operation at a time per thread.
     
     interpreted compiled
     scripting language - we can integrate to web page


     html css- static webpages- browser
     js - dynamic web pages- javascript engine - browser
          runtime environment - node js - we can run js without browser

    js engines
    chrome - v8 engine
    firefox - spider monkey
    edge-chakra
    safari - javascript core


    how javascript engine works

    code - 
    parsing - checks the syntax 
    abstract syntax tree- tokens genrate- categorized
    interpreter - converts - takes helps from compiler - jit(just in time)
    execution


    console.log("line 1")
    console.log("line 2")---time -60mins
    console.log("line 3")


    synchronous tasks
    line 1
    line 3

    asynchrnous tasks- whihc takes time and execute parallely
     line 2


     event loop mechanism
     1) callstack - executes the functions 
     2) webapi - provides some apis (timers,location, apicalls)
     3) callback que-
     4) event loop -


     line 1- 
     line - 2- takes time
     line - 3
     line -4 - takes time
     line - 5
     1000lines
